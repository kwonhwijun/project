[YONHAP]        In Busan’s third presentation to host the World Expo 2030 in Paris, a cheerful-looking girl named Asia Campbell accompanied the city mayor as one of the speakers promoting the city's bid.      The 15-year-old Campbell, nicknamed "the granddaughter of the Korean War veterans,” showed up once again in April in Busan as a guide to the Bureau International des Expositions’ (BIE) delegation during their on-site inspection of the city’s proposed venue for the expo.    Born to a Canadian father and a Korean mother, Campbell is a native-born Busan citizen who has been living in the city her entire life.      Serving as the youth ambassador of the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Korea, Campbell has been working across diverse fields to represent Korea, such as the head of the United Nations Youth Environment Assembly and an ambassador of the Paper Culture Foundation.      "Busan is not taking the expo as just a one-time event, but as a way to work together and find solutions to all of the problems out there," Campbell said in a recent interview with the Korea JoongAng Daily. "My hometown Busan will be the perfect setting for this global platform."    The interview has been edited for clarity and length.

You have so many nicknames such as the “granddaughter of Korean War veterans” or “little diplomat.” I’d like to hear your story about how you got those nicknames.     A. It all started a few years back, around 2016 when I won a contest called "Writing a Letter to the Korean War Veterans." I won it two years in a row, and I got this amazing chance to visit Korean War veterans in places like England, Belgium and the Netherlands.      After that, it was like a spark — I just kept in touch with the veterans, and whenever they visited Korea, I was there to welcome them. Since then whenever I meet the veterans they call me their little granddaughter or the little ambassador.  You gave a speech at the third presentation for Busan’s bid to host the World Expo 2030 held in Paris in November. Do you have any memorable moments?    The presentation itself was a mix of excitement and those usual pre-performance jitters. I felt the atmosphere of the conference room was most energetic when Korea's delegation gave the speeches. Our presentation was received with the loudest applause from the people from the BIE members, maybe because Korea's presentation had many aspects to capture their attention such as a scene from "Squid Game."      After the presentation, at the reception, I overheard someone saying that our speech actually made them want to visit Busan.      I still have a lot of excitement about this particular section of my speech: "Our hope for the World Expo 2030 is not that it will be some grand show just for that year. But a journey of building the platform we need for working together and finding real solutions to all the problems we have to deal with. And trust me, my hometown Busan will be the perfect setting for this kind of global platform — one that is truly open and accessible to everyone."    The way Busan is approaching the expo, where it will view it as the beginning of the journey to solve urgent challenges facing humanity, is the biggest differentiating point compared to other contenders.

[YONHAP]       As a Busan native, what do you think are the most appealing aspects that distinguish Busan from Saudi Arabia's Riyadh and Italy's Rome?   Busan is an incredible blend of water and mountains. Just having that wonderful natural energy sets us apart.    But the one factor that really shines in the city is the people. Busan has a history of being a haven during times of war, and that's left its mark on us. You can feel that connection to our past everywhere you go. We're all about welcoming visitors, showing off our hospitality and being super proud of our country. We're that extra welcoming friend you're always excited to hang out with.    When it comes to Expo 2030, it's not just about winning an event bid — it's about sharing our heart, culture and the warmth of Busan with the world.      You were a tour guide of the BIE delegation when they visited Busan in April. What was their reaction?     They really liked Busan. They said they felt like The Beatles when they first arrived at Busan Station thanks to the Busan citizens' enthusiastic welcome. Also when they had a tour of the Wall of Remembrance, they were impressed to know that so many soldiers from foreign countries died supporting the Korean war.      I can remember one of the BIE members actually remembered their spot during my presentation in Paris. He said he was right there on my left in the front row.      Lastly, could you please share a message of support for Busan's endeavor to host the 2030 World Expo?  The World Expo isn't just about buildings and events — it's about our city's heart and soul coming to life. Join us in making history.    By backing Busan's bid, you're supporting a city that's all about connection, culture and global friendship. Let's make the expo an unforgettable chapter in our story.
